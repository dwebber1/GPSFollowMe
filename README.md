### GPS Follow Me Game, powered by Arduino (Daniel Webber , 2015)
* This program was written for the Arduino UNO

* The GPS data is sent over the serial and then parsed only for the cordinates.

* This project is a simple where you set the location, and then leave it. When you get near the location depending on a threshold it will tell you that you are at your location.

* I used an LCD screen, a GPS Receiver - EM-506 (48 Channel).
